Project Title: Doppler Shift Simulator & Mobility Channel Analyzer

Description:
This MATLAB application simulates Doppler shift effects in wireless communication systems.
It computes Doppler shift, received frequency, coherence time, and channel classification
based on user mobility parameters.

Requirements:
- MATLAB R2023 or later
- App Designer support

How to Run:
1. Open MATLAB
2. Open the file: app1.mlapp
3. Click Run
4. Enter carrier frequency, speed, and angle
5. Press "Calculate Doppler"

Outputs:
- Doppler shift (Hz)
- Received frequency
- Coherence time
- Channel type
- Doppler plots vs speed and angle
